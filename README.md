# Solo Flix (Front end)

This project is a website that emulates Netflix, featuring a selection of movies along with their titles and descriptions. It allows users to browse and stream video trailers.

This repository contains the code for the front-end of the application. The front-end is built using React which gets the movie data from the resource server. The application provides a responsive and user-friendly interface that allows users to browse movies by category, search for specific titles, and watch them seamlessly.

Before accessing the resources from the resource server, the user must login with correct credentials. The app will use these credentials to make a request to the authorization server. Once approved, the app gets an access token and the user is redirected to the main page where the data is able to load.
